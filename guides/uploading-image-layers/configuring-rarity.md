# Configuring Rarity

You can adjust the rarity of each layer image. This effects how many of the layer will appear in the entire collection. The default values for rarity are based on fixed ratios. However you can manually enter a fixed number of times you would like a layer to appear in the collection.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Empty Layers**: If you would like an image to be optional, please upload an empty transparent PNG image
{% endhint %}
