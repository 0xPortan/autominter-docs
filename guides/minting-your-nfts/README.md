# Minting your NFTs

## Minting Basics

Each of your NFTs must be Minted. This is the initial assignment of the NFTs in the collection to an owner. In AutoMinter, this initial assignment is done via "Minting Pages". These pages allow anyone with the link to make the initial purchase directly from you.



By having the first purchaser mint the NFT, it means the cost of gas is paid by the initial minter. Rather than the contract owner (you) paying gas for every single NFT.



This method also allows NFTs to be assigned randomly on chain. So that the minter does not know exactly what NFT they will receive.



Only after each NFT is minted, can it be traded on OpenSea.
