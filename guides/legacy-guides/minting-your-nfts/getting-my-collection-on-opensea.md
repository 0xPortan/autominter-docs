# Getting my collection on OpenSea

Once individual NFTs in your collection have been minted they will automatically be available on OpenSea. To view your collection, you must simply sign into OpenSea and your collection will automatically be imported.



## Images not showing in OpenSea?

If your images are not showing in OpenSea, it is likely for 2 reasons. Firstly you may still see a message in your collection showing that the images are syncing with IPFS.

Secondly it takes some time for OpenSea to fetch and cache the images. This delay is not determined by AutoMinter so the duration may vary.
