# Change Network

When changing network in AutoMinter, you must ensure that your wallet is configured with the network as an option. For example if your wallet doesn't not have polygon configured by default, you must manually add it to polygon.

You may also need to manually switch networks within your wallet app depending on which wallet you've used
