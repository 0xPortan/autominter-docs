# Ethereum vs Polygon

Should you create an NFT collection on Ethereum on Polygon? That's a good question. Lets explore the differences between the two and why you might choose to use one over the other.



### What is Ethereum and Polygon?

Ethereum and Polygon are both Ethereum compatible blockchains. You can create and sell NFTs on either of the networks. Polygon is a blockchain which is built on top of Ethereum and has much lower network fees (known as "Gas")

Ethereum is the original blockchain NFTs and has a reputation for being more secure and battle tested.

### Ethereum NFTs are worth more

The main advantage to Ethereum NFTs is that more people want to own NFTs on Ethereum, therefore they are worth more.

### Polygon is cheaper to deploy

The main advantage to Polygon is that it is cheaper to use. So minting, creating your contract and trading doesn't have such high fees as the Ethereum Mainnet.

### Polygon is slightly harder to use

Because polygon is a Layer 2 blockchain. It is harder for people to get funds on their wallet for polygon as they much use the Polygon bridge to do so. This barrier makes it harder to sell NFTs on polygon.
