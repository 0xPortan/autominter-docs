# IPFS Syncing

Once your NFT collection is deployed, your images will be synced with IPFS. This may take some time, and in some cases 24 hours for large collections.&#x20;

Please note you are able to mint NFTs right away, but until the IPFS sync is complete the images may not be visible right away in some apps.
