## Minting

Once you're NFT collection is finalised. People must make an initial purchase known as "Minting". There are multiple ways that people can mint, including from the dedicated web pages provided by AutoMinter, or Buttons which you can add to your own website.



## Whitelists

AutoMinter Lists is a separate stand-alone tool for collecting wallets for early access to your NFT drops. You can use it to both create exclusivity and remove bots so you can ensure your NFTs are purchased by real humans.
