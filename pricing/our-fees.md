# Our Fees

Deploying your contract to the Ethereum (ETH) network with AutoMinter is 10x cheaper than a traditional smart contract. There is a 0.05 ETH paid to AutoMinter and approx. 0.01 - 0.02 ETH paid in gas fees.

Deploying you contract on the Polygon network is free from AutoMinter fees but you need to pay gas fees to the underlying network.

AutoMinter keeps 10% of the creators revenue. In the future you will be able to earn a stake in AutoMinter DAO in return for your commission.
