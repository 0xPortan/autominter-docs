# Generating Artwork

Once you've uploaded your image layers, you are now ready to generate your artwork

Hit the "Generate Artwork" button and enter the number of NFTs you would like in your collection. Beware that if you want to generate a collection greater than 1000 images, you will need to wait a few hours. Smaller collections are much faster.

Remember that if you entered custom image quantities in your collection. The total number of quantities in each layer should add up to the number of images generated.

If you selected groups, you will have to add the number of NFTs that are generated for each group. If you have 2 groups with 500 art pieces each. Then 1000 pieces will be generated for the final collection.
