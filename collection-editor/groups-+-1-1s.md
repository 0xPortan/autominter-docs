# Groups + 1/1s

You can use AutoMinter to create groups add 1/1s in your collection. For example, you may want Men and Women to appear in your collection. And you may not want the traits to mix between them (e.g. beards only appear on men)

### Add unique NFTs to the collection

1/1s are individual NFTs which are not composed of layers, simply individual images to be added to the same collection.

### How to add groups

Create groups in the collection editor. These are treated like separate generations and are combined into the same collection at the end.

Later when you generate your artwork, you must specify the number to be generated from each group.
