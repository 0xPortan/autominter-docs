# Rarity + Metadata

You can adjust the rarity of each layer image. This affects how many of the layers will appear. The default values for rarity are based on fixed ratios. However you can manually enter a fixed number of times you would like a layer to appear in the collection.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Empty Layers**: If you would like an image to be optional, please upload an empty transparent PNG image
{% endhint %}
