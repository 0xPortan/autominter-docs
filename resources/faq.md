**What is the cost to deploy a contract with AutoMinter?**

Deploying your contract to the Ethereum (ETH) network with AutoMinter is 10x cheaper than a traditional smart contract. There is a 0.05 ETH paid to AutoMinter and approx. 0.01 - 0.02 ETH paid in gas fees.

Deploying you contract on the Polygon network is free from AutoMinter fees but you need to pay gas fees.

**What other costs are there to use AutoMinter?**

AutoMinter will receive 10% of the revenue from the initial minting of your collection and 10% of any royalties from sales on sites such as Opensea. Royalties are set by you so if you set them at 10% of the sale price AutoMinter will receive 1% of sale price.

**How to I set the rarity of traits on AutoMinter?**

When using the available rarity options the ratio is compared to other images in the same layer For example, you have a layer with:

* 2 common images (100 each)
* 1 rare image (20)

The ratio would be 100: 100: 20 (also the same as 5:5:1) If you generated 44 images, this would produce: 20, 20, and 4 images of each (a ratio of 5:5:1)

Alternatively, you can enter the specific number of times you want a trait to appear and that image is ignored by the ratio mentioned above.

**Can I have a whitelist with AutoMinter?**

Yes! AutoMinter supports the use of Whitelists. Once you have collected your whitelist addresses, they can be uploaded to the dashboard via text file. You can then toggle whitelist minting on and off as required.

**How can I see my collection on OpenSea?**

Once individual NFTs in your collection have been minted they will automatically be available on OpenSea. To view your collection, you must sign into Opensea and import the collection. https://docs.opensea.io/docs/5-create-your-storefront https://autominter.gitbook.io/autominter/guides/minting-your-nfts/getting-my-collection-on-opensea



**How do I upload all my images to OpenSea?**
