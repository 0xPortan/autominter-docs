# Reserve NFTs

&#x20;You can reserve NFTs. Allowing you to release the NFTs in batches, or restrict the supply.

You can only do this if you selected "sequential" as the minting option.

If you reserve NFTs these will not be available for minting. But you can later reduce the number of NFTs to make them available.



It is possible to use reservations to burn un-minted supply
