# Customize Mint Pages

Once you have deployed your collection. People will be able to mint from your mint website or embeddable mint buttons.

You may customise the mint website by:

* Changing the background color
* Changing the image on the screen to an animated gif or upload your own image
* For even more customisation you can embed the mint widget in a custom website
