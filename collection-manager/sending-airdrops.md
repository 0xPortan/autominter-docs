# Sending Airdrops



AutoMinter makes it easy to perform Airdrops, which enables you to give away NFTs for free! This means the receiver can acquire an NFT without having to pay any fees. This concept is great for promotions and rewarding active community members and contributors

## Send individual Airdrops

Once your collection is created and added to the blockchain you can enter a token ID of the NFT you would like to airdrop along with the address of the wallet you would like to send the NFT too.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will receive an error if you try to airdrop and NFT which has already been minted.
{% endhint %}

## Bulk sending airdrops

You are able to send bulk airdrops to multiple addresses at once. Please paste your addresses in the bulk airdrop form and ensure they are formatted correctly.&#x20;
