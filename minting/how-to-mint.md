# How to Mint

The easiest way to mint from an AutoMinter collection is from the mint page provided in the dashboard.

## Minting from Mint Pages

Users must have metamask installed, and an appropriate ETH balance. They must press "connect wallet" if they haven't already and proceed to "mint"

## Minting from Etherscan

If you are minting without whitelisting, you are able to mint directly from etherscan on the contract. You can find your contract address from the Eterscan link in your AutoMinter dashboard.

Please note that if you are whitelisted, and you want to mint from etherscan, you will need the signature for your whitelist spot. This is not recommended, and it is preferred to use the mint website or mint widgets for whitelisted wallets.
