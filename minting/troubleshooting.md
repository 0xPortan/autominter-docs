# Troubleshooting

If you are having problems minting from a collection on AutoMinter. Please consult this guide for assistance.



### The mint button is greyed out

This occurs if you are unable to mint. It may be that the project creator has not made the collection "public" yet. Or you may not be added to the whitelist.

If neither of these are the case, your wallet may be failing to connect to the RPC nodes on the network. Please refresh the page or try changing the PRC nodes in your wallet if this is the case



### Gas prices are over $10,000

This probably means there is an error attempting the transaction. Often when you don't have enough funds in your wallet
