# Mint On Custom Website

You do not have to use AutoMinters mint pages for people to mint your NFTs. If you want more control, you can embed the mint buttons into your own custom website.

### Add Mint button to a website

To add a mint button to a website. Expand "more options" in the "mint page" section of your collection.

Copy the embed code and place it as part of the HTML on your website

* On the page you want to edit click "add", then "embed code" and add a "custom element"
* drag the custom element where you want it to show on your page
